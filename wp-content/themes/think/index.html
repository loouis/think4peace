				<p>Our challenge is to get these young people to re-THINK the way they behave, encouraging them to become responsive rather than reactive.</p>
 
				<p>Often they are unaware that their beliefs and values directly affect their attitude and behaviour, so with THINK we help them challenge their current beliefs and attitudes that justify violent responses to conflict.</p>
 
				<p>We are fully aware that violent extremist groups use prejudice and discrimination as a way to gain support, so it’s vital that we make young people realise that there is another way, and that they can turn their back on extremism and become positive leaders within their peer group and society as a whole.</p>

						<h5 class="tblue">Introductory Session</h5>
						<p>We visit the schools and colleges taking part and spend a day with the young people who are going to benefit from THINK, by introducing the programme and explaining what the Foundation does. This acts as a bit of a taster for them, and as they’re in familiar surroundings they feel safe and secure and are more likely to open up to us. The facilitator for the programme chats to each of them personally, and then they take part in a group session.</p>

						<h5 class="tblue">THINK recruitment</h5>
						<p>We work with relevant schools to identify those young people who would benefit most from taking part in THINK. We then have a chat with each of them to explain what THINK entails, so we can work out if there are any specific needs that need addressing to ensure that they get the most out of the programme.</p>

				<h5 class="tblue">Two Three-day long residential programmes</h5>
				<p>The first of these carries on the conversations from the introductory stage, but goes on to explore some of the issues already raised and explores them in greater depth. There are never more than 16 young people on any residential course, and there are two facilitators who work with the group.</p>

					<h2>The Benefits</h2> 
					<p>THINK</p>

					<h4 class="tblue">
						Over the course of the three days, those taking part will hear from survivors, experts, and former extremists who share their stories, and will role-play real life situations, putting in place new strategies to manage conflict and to challenge extremism, prejudice and discrimination. Participants learn and practice cognitive life skills by looking at theirs and others’ behaviour, questioning what’s behind it, and trying to find a solution that is constructive rather than destructive.
